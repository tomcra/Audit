<h2>Add a maker to the map</h2>

<h3>Add button</h3>

<p>The add button should sit at the bottom left of the page.</p>

<p>This button should act in different ways depending if it is a touch interface or a mouse interface.</p>

<p><b>Mode 1 for setting marker</b> In a touch interface it should add a maker to the centre of the map and add a set
    button to the bottom of the screen. This will enable the map to be moved around and zoomed in and out whilst the
    marker remains in the same position. This enables accurate positioning of the marker without fingers covering the
    location that the Marker needs to be put.</p>

<p><b>Mode 2 for setting marker</b> In a mouse interface the it is possibly better to use the more traditional way of
    placing maker <b>(TODO: This needs to be validated)</b> where the marker is dragged and dropped onto a location on
    the map. In this case the positioning of the marker is more accurate as there is no visual obstruction from a
    finger. The work flow would be to drag the marker to the location and click to place in the event that the marker is
    no in the exact position user can subsequently zoom in and then drag the marker a second time to reposition more
    accurately</p>
